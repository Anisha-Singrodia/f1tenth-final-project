## Model Training Updates

The model is currently not learning. Here are the curves of training -

One evaluation metric implemented is the trajectory plot:

## Next steps: 
- Change model - try a ResNet family architecture from literature
- Look into better pre-processing techniques over normalisation
- Try model training using the updated v_y values from the VICON and record performance updates
